# Sky the Fly
This is a digital picture book written, curated, and programmed by Lexi Averbuj, Will Kheriaty, and Eloise Pelham.

We wanted to make a picture book with interactive and visually engaging features that aren't possible with paper books. Using Javascript, we plan to add animations triggered by user inputs. This will help to familiarize kids with computer skills, while being in a fun and familiar format.

## Next steps
* Add illustrations to pages 2-8
* Add individual assets for interactive components
* Make buttons prettier
* Program js interactive/animated features
* Add cues for how to interact- must be comprehensible to kids
